# General

* Stress the importance of **copy-paste**, maybe have a slide for that (*Good programmers copy* or so)

* Highlight the importance of **searching** for solutions online (*Google is your friend*, StackOverflow) and being able to **scan** results.

* Introduce the mindset of **seeing behind the scenes**, having a way to understand what's going on so that we can hack/fix it.

* **Research** task on competitor apps

* Working knowledge of a Mac is desired, otherwise here's a cheatsheet with common **shortcuts**.

* Advertise on Facebook! See [this post](https://www.facebook.com/baddeo/posts/10153016996871222)...


# Day 1

### What went well

* Great atmosphere - open space room, table arrangement in U-shape, a few plants
* Getting to know each other - students introduced one another, friendly dynamic
* Great opening conversation getting excited about apps and the future of technology
* Asking the students questions as a way to get them thinking and coming up with solutions and reasons

### Areas for improvement

* Conversations sometimes need steering away from dead ends, for instance how many billions celebrities make from apps
* Using visual cues to move conversations forward
* Need to emphasise that we are teaching simplified templates for prototyping purposes - managing expectations
* Need to explain that the app-building process is extensive and takes a lot of work, a long process
* Emphasise how important it is to build great, fully thought-through prototypes to be able to have informed conversations with designers, developers, partners etc

### Action points

* Explain what CodePen is
* Use `head` and `body`
* Explain Mac shortcuts (copy, paste, scroll etc)
* Slide to **manage expectations** after introductions


# Day 2

### What went well

* Having many lecturers to communicate that "there isn't just one way" and gave them multiple perspectives.
* Engaged by the playful demonstration
* Felt involved with team work.
* Didn't feel scared to say things.
* Balance between coding practice and process learning is well balanced

### Areas for improvement

* Being open space could distract them when there are someone talking outside class.
* It would be nice if the tables are easier to move around.
* Want to try something easier which is more rewarding (possibly something more visual or sound, playful)

### Action points

* Find fun activities for end of day
* How to market your app and idea? (Find where we can direct them to another resources)
* Resources / links: jQuery courses etc.
* JS library: how do you know if thats good library?


# Day 3

### What went well

* Hot Berta is a good example of bad design
* GoodUI examples and discussion that followed
* Wireframes (good and bad) examples

### Areas for improvement

* Be realistic about how much new coding concepts one can take in a couple of hours.

### Action points

* Swap coding session from AM to PM, so that we avoid late-comers to get lost
* Code indentation (tidiness) is important
* Codepen JS hint?
* **Research** task on competitor apps
* Write out JS functions on post-its and work out together which order they will be put together. Then split people up into groups and get them to write the code that makes the app work


# Day 4

### What went well

* Wireframes presentations: students gave and received valuable comments, which showed they are applying their design thinking and put what they've been learning into practice.
* Feedback was very honest. Plenty of suggestions and no back-patting or false flattery.
* Students were really open to taking on board and integrating feedback.
* Starting at 10:30 allowed us more time to prepare the room (which is always a dump when we arrive)

### Areas for improvement

* Time management: we didn't realise how long it would take people to do competitor research and presenting ideas.
* Moderation: need to balance discussion between business ideas and design / execution.

### Action points

* Give structure to the presentations, eg list questions that people need to cover
* Guide research process: user-testing other apps


# Day 5

### What went well

* Inspiring projects made with Web tech sparked conversation and set a positive tone for the day: *JavaScript is cool* 
* JS challenge gave people a practice ground

### Areas for improvement

* Copy this JS into your CodePen but keep your HTML and CSS

### Action points

* NEXT SESSION:
	* Show inspiring resources for CSS (eg: css-tricks.com)
	* Demo how to code the `tap on search results to reveal more info` interaction
	* Include images to make the app more engaging
* FUTURE: Use the [TfL API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs)


# Day 6

### What went well

* Celebrations: cupcakes and juice
* Collaborative debugging
* Sharing resources

### Areas for improvement

* Coding session was disjointed, as a result of us making things up as we go along. People had to delete stuff, fiddly.
* **JS** file with ~400 lines is confusing for *anyone*. We had to do it this way because [CodePen](https://codepen.io) (the Web-based code editor we used throughout the course) doesn't allow  more than 1 file per language. Next time we can migrate to [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org)
* Final **presentations** should be more informal, just gathering around the computers with a cupcake and showing each other the apps we made.
* Presentations in general could be more informal.
* Using [building blocks](http://zurb.com/building-blocks), rather than building things from scratch, can be useful for learners that may just want to get a general understanding of  coding practices, but are more interested in prototyping ideas rather than labouring over the details.

### Action points

* Check out [Ionic](https://creator.ionic.io) and [Flow](https://flowhub.io/) for visual programming?
* Get people familiar and comfortable with the **JS Console**
